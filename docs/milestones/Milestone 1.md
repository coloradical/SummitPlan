## Description
Summit Plan is a website that allows you to enter criteria to find the perfect 14er (or hiking trails depending on how much effort we want to put in this) to hike.
* Enter criteria like hike length, skill level, distance from home and more to help you choose the best 14er to climb
* Aggregates weather averages from past years to determine when it's safest to be on that particular mountain
* Live weather updates
* Traffic and directions from Google Maps
* Data page describing the basics of each 14er (round trip length, photos, trailhead name, coordinates, lakes and streams nearby, snow pack information and any other relevant info
* Download information offline
* Tracks which 14ers or trails you've completed, along with your summit time
* Overall interactive map showing where all the 14ers are

## Vision Statement
We want to make it easier for mountain enthusiasts to find the perfect 14er for their outing, and to ensure the safety and education of new climbers.

## Motivation
Our team loves the outdoors and has experienced the struggle of trying to find information on these challenging mountains prior to climbing them. We want to make a beatiful, simple interface to find and browse information on Colorado's 14,000_ ft. peaks.

## Risks
* Our team has unequal experience with web development, and varying depths of understanding of programming
* Using data from various APIs to bring together a cohesive webapp will present a number of challenges

## Risk Mitigation Plan
* Assigning team members tasks that fit their skills - for example, giving programming heavy tasks to skilled programmers, and art heavy tasks to peple who like to design
* Time management - everyone is busy so we need to adjust schedules to find a good time for everyone
* Avoiding over-zealous scope - There's a million things this website could do well, given enough time, but we'll need to keep our scope and focus concise to deliver a working product my the end of the class

## Version Control
We will be using git and GitHub to collaborate on our project together. 

## Development Method
We will be using the Agile development method. Agile will allow for flexibility in the design of our product, and for thorough testing. By completing two week sprints, we will at any point be able to change our desing if the testing of the previous sprint did not go as planned. It also allows us to implement and relsase new features throughout the development of the project as needed.

## Collaboration Tool
We will be using Slack to communicate and collaborate. Slack allows us to easily discuss ideas with one another and share code and files. Its wide-ranging feature set will be benificial as we work remotely and together.

## Proposed Architecture
We'll be building our app on the Ruby on Rails web framework, likely along with a front-end CSS framework such as Boostratp or MaterializeCSS.
